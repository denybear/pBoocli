Audio looper on raspberry PI pico - Proof of Concept

This repo explores the concept of developing an audio looper on a raspberry PI pico.
Audio looper shall have the following capabilities:

* work on a limited piece of hardware, ie. Raspberry PI pico
* work with a master midi clock coming from a groovebox, to synchronize audio loops to an external clock
* ... but also be able to work without external clock
* be able to capture audio from guitar/bass and output to line out

This project is both hardware and software project, in a "proof-of-concept" mode.
